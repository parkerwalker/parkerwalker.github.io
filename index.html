      <h2>Summary</h2>
       <p>I graduated Forest Lake High School in June 2013 and enrolled in St. Paul College to start general education. After a year of generals St. Paul I left becuase I didn't know which career path I wanted to follow. Upon leaving I began building my people skills and honing my computer skills. I discovered I loved working with different kinds of people and with technology, I made sure any task I had been assigned to or taken on ran smoothly.</p>
